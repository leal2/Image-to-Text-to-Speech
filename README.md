# Image-to-Text-to-Speech
<p>Uses a webcam to take an image and convert it to text which allows a text-to-speech bot to read it.</p>
<p>The translation is not perfect and neither is the text scraping. Works very well when camera is perfectly in focus.</p> 
<p>Intended to be used as an accessability supplement for those who have poor vision</p>
- Made using OpenCV and Python in May 2023



- Text-to-speech only works with English.

- Requires tesseract to work (make sure to change tesseract path in code before running)
