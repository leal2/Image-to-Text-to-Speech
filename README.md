# Image-to-Text-to-Speech
Uses a webcam to take an image and convert it to text which allows a text-to-speech bot to read it.
The translation is not perfect and neither is the text scraping. Works very well when camera is perfectly in focus. 

Text-to-speech only works with English.

Requires tesseract to work.
